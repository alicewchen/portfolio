## Experience

#### Data Scientist, Pacefactory (August 2021-March 2022)
- Created an interactive **Jupyter** dashboard for the **exploratory data analysis** of **OpenCV** object detection and tracking data, uncovering patterns that influenced the performance of a **decision tree model**
- Created a machine learning **Flask** app to detect and visualize high-traffic zones using live object tracking data stored in **MongoDB**; the **clustering algorithm was deployed to the production environment** to assist users during software configuration

  
#### Teaching Assistant, University of Toronto Mississauga (2018-2021)
- Instructed undergraduates how to perform **data visualization** and **hypothesis testing** using **R**
- Provided technical guidance to students learning **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, and pattern matching
- Created a reusable JupyterHub & R FAQ for off-hour student support
  
#### Quantitative Analyst, University of Toronto Mississauga (2016-2017)
- Performed literature research to collect and analyze effect size distribution in evolutionary ecology literature

## Projects
#### [Overview of Bitcoin Ordinals](https://btc-ordinal-dashboard.onrender.com/)
This on-chain analysis offers an overview of the volume and cost associated with Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions. The fee estimator was created using [multiple linear regression (R<sup>2</sup>=0.96)](https://github.com/alicewchen/dashboard/blob/main/notebooks/linear_model.ipynb) to predict the inscription cost based on the anticipated size and quantity of ordinals to be minted.
