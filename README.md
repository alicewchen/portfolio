# Data Scientist

## Education

#### MSc. Ecology and Evolutionary Biology @ University of Toronto
- Cleaned and transformed messy gene and protein expression data using Python for exploratory data analysis.
- Derived experimental insights using statistical and ML techniques with Python & R: regression, bootstrap, PCA.
- Created data visualizations and reports to storytell actionable experimental insights and communicate foreseeable risks and challenges.
- Developed reproducible data workflows with Bash and Python using Snakemake.
- Performed large-scale simulated resamples using a high performance computing cluster to estimate population genetics statistics.

## Experience

#### Data Scientist, Pacefactory (August 2021-March 2022)
- Created an interactive Jupyter plotly dashboard for the exploratory data analysis of OpenCV object detection and tracking data, uncovering patterns that influenced the performance of a decision tree
- Created a Flask app that runs on an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using cluster analysis to detect and visualize high-traffic zones from live object tracking data. The pipeline was deployed to the production environment to assist users during software configuration

  
#### Teaching Assistant, University of Toronto Mississauga (2018-2021)
- Relevant courses taught: Biostatistics I, Bioinformatics
- Instructed undergraduates on how to create data visualizations and perform statistical testing using R.
- Provided technical guidance to students learning pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and pattern matching.
- Created an online FAQ of Python, R, and statistical knowledge to provide off-hour student support.
  
#### Quantitative Analyst, University of Toronto Mississauga (2016-2017)
- Created data visualizations of effect size distribution in ecology literature using R.
- Delivered weekly updates to the supervisor to explain Excel database schema design, code structure, and analysis results.

## Projects
#### [Overview of Bitcoin Ordinals](https://btc-ordinal-dashboard.onrender.com/)
- Performed SQL queries to retrieve data from an on-chain data provider
- Created and deployed a Flask app to visualize the historical volume and cost associated with Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions, uncovering notable events based on abnormal time series patterns.
- Developed a fee estimator using multiple linear regression (R2=0.96) to predict the inscription cost
