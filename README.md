## Experience

#### Data Scientist, Pacefactory (August 2021-March 2022)
- Created an interactive Jupyter plotly dashboard for the exploratory data analysis of OpenCV object detection and tracking data, uncovering patterns that influenced the performance of a decision tree
- Created a Flask app that runs on an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using cluster analysis to detect and visualize high-traffic zones from live object tracking data. The pipeline was deployed to the production environment to assist users during software configuration

  
#### Teaching Assistant, University of Toronto Mississauga (2018-2021)
- Instructed undergraduates how to perform data visualization and hypothesis testing using R
- Provided technical guidance to students learning pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and pattern matching
- Created a reusable JupyterHub & R FAQ for off-hour student support
  
#### Quantitative Analyst, University of Toronto Mississauga (2016-2017)
- Performed literature research to collect and analyze effect size distribution in evolutionary ecology literature

## Projects
#### [Overview of Bitcoin Ordinals](https://btc-ordinal-dashboard.onrender.com/)
- Performed SQL queries to retrieve data from an on-chain data provider
- Created and deployed a Flask app to visualize the historical volume and cost associated with Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions, uncovering notable events based on abnormal time series patterns.
- Developed a fee estimator using multiple linear regression (R2=0.96) to predict the inscription cost
