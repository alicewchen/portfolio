## Experience
Data Scientist @ Pacefactory (August 2021-March 2022)
- Developed a Jupyter dashboard for exploratory data analysis of object detection and tracking data; presented data insights that highlighted the key features impacting decision tree model performance.
- Built a machine learning Flask app to detect and visualize high-traffic zones based live camera data using cluster analysis; the clustering algorithm was deployed to the production environment to assist users during software configuration
  
Teaching Assistant, University of Toronto Mississauga (2018-2021)
- Instructed undergraduates how to perform data visualization and hypothesis testing using R
- Provided technical guidance to students learning pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and pattern matching
- Created a reusable JupyterHub & R FAQ for off-hour student support

  <summary>Overview of Bitcoin Ordinals</summary>

  
  [Link](https://btc-ordinal-dashboard.onrender.com/) This on-chain analysis offers an overview of the volume and cost associated with Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions. The fee estimator was created using a multiple linear regression (R<sup>2</sup>=0.96) to predict the inscription cost based on the anticipated size and quantity of ordinals to be minted.
