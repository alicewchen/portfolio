## Projects
#### Case Study: Strategizing a Kickstarter Campaign ([repo](https://github.com/alicewchen/kickstarter-case-study), [report](https://github.com/alicewchen/kickstarter-case-study/blob/main/report/report.md))
- Performed API requests to collect historical currency exchange rates.
- Created local SQL database and performed complex SQL queries to analyze historical Kickstarter campaign data.
  
#### [Overview of Bitcoin Ordinals](https://btc-ordinal-dashboard.onrender.com/)
- Performed SQL queries to retrieve data from an on-chain data provider
- Created and deployed a Flask app to visualize the historical volume and cost associated with Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions, uncovering notable events based on abnormal time series patterns.
- Developed a fee estimator using multiple linear regression (R2=0.96) to predict the inscription cost

## Experience

#### Data Scientist, Pacefactory (2021-2022)
- Debugged and fixed issues in the front-end codebase using Typescript.
- Developed an interactive Jupyter dashboard for the exploratory data analysis of computer vision data to improve the performance of a machine learning model and presented actionable insights to senior executives resulting in new software development decisions.
- Researched and recommended data requirements and machine learning methods to identify high traffic zones in manufacturing facilities from computer vision data.
- Developed a Python Flask application in a Linux environment with machine learning model integration to visualize the model outcomes, implemented the machine learning pipeline using RESTful API to query live data from MongoDB databases for model training, and coordinated with the development team to deploy it as a new feature in a dockerized application.
  
#### Teaching Assistant, University of Toronto Mississauga (2018-2021)
- Relevant courses taught: Biometrics I & II (ANOVA, Bayesian Methods, Chi-Square test, Descriptive Statistics, Hypothesis
Testing, Probability Distribution), Bioinformatics, Field Methods and Statistical Analyses in Ecology, Genomics
- Instructed in biostatistics and bioinformatics courses to improve student knowledge in data visualization and statistical analysis using Python and R.
- Created and maintained an online resource repository, providing round-the-clock academic support in Python, R, and statistics and resulted in shorter student queues during office hours.

#### Research Assistant, University of Toronto Mississauga (May 2017 - Aug 2017)
- Performed multivariate testing on experimental data from algal mating compatibility experiments using R.
- Delivered experimental reports as lab presentations to communicate insights derived from experimental data.

#### Quantitative Analyst, University of Toronto Mississauga (Sept 2016- Feb 2017)
- Conducted literature review on evolutionary ecology meta-analyses to collect effect size data, generated
bootstrap distributions of effect sizes, and created data visualizations using R to explain ecological data trends.
- Maintained consistent, clear communication with the supervisor, delivering weekly updates on coding practices
and analytical findings.

#### Research Assistant, University of Toronto Mississauga (May 2015 - Aug 2015)
- Performed time series analyses of trehalose content in locust hemolymph using R and presented experimental
findings to project supervisors.

## Education

#### MSc. Ecology and Evolutionary Biology @ University of Toronto
- Designed and executed experimental procedures iteratively to develop standard operating procedures with minimal guidance.
- Analyzed experimental data and derived experimental insights using multivariate statistical and machine learning methods with Python and R libraries.
- Created data visualizations and reports to storytell actionable experimental insights, recommend protocol improvements, and communicate foreseeable experimental risks and challenges.
- Developed reproducible Snakemake data workflows using Bash and Python to perform large-scale bootstrap simulations in parallel using a high performance computing cluster in a Linux environment.
- Trained three undergraduate research students in aseptic techniques of propagating algal samples and supervised one undergraduate research project to completion.

#### H.B.Sc. Biology Specialist, University of Toronto Mississauga
- Publication: Anstett, D.N., Chen, W. & Johnson, M.T.J. Latitudinal Gradients in Induced and Constitutive Resistance against Herbivores. *J Chem Ecol* **42**, 772â€“781 (2016)
- Relevant coursework: Biostatistics I & II (descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, Chi-Square test, Bayesian methods), Bioinformatics, Genomics
